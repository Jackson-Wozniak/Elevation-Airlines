airports.csv comes from our-airports.com, but importantly is pre-filtered before being
    placed in the zip file. I have removed airports with types that are irrelevant to
    Elevation Airlines (closed, heliport, seaplane), and also remove extra data such as links.
    I keep both the indent code, as well as the local code. Airports without a GPS code are
    also removed before saving.
